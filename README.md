## Scope of project

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Changes made

- Added alt text to images
- Updated title
- Updated element tags to be more semantic (Header, section, nav, aside, footer)
- Condensed redundent CSS classes
- Put aside images as id and background images
- Commented sections on CSS sheet


## What I learned

- Elements of semantic HTML
- Difference and usage of id and class
