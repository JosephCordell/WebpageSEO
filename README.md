# HORISEON Website Refactoring

## Scope of project
```
Update the webpage so that it meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
